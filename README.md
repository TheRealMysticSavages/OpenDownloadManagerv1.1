# Information

*This is a download manager which offers basic functions, like downloading files at much faster speeds. You won't need any requesites.
If you find anything wrong with the code, I have left the sources along with the installer, as most developers do.*

## Why did I code in C#?

*Earlier, I made a download manager with the same design, except it was coded in the 'dead' language, VB.NET. When
I debugged the project, I noticed three problems right off the bat.*

  *1 - The progress bar would not move, but stay idle while the file downloaded.*
  
  *2 - The save location of the downloaded file would default to the project location (the Debug folder).*
  
  *3 - Downloading files over 1 gigabyte would throw an exception, which would stop the download process.*
  
*So, I immediately closed the project. I started to consider a code that was console-based like Java or Python, but it would 
probably require some sort of additional software just to run it. Plus, I wanted the download manager to include a GUI to be intuitive.*

*And, long story short, I found C#. I coded the project for it and tested it, and it worked.*

## Where do I get the download manager?

*You can get the source code and installer [here](https://github.com/TheRealMysticSavages/OpenDownloadManager/releases/tag/v1.1). You're welcome.*
